## Hey! I'm Dzhangir(pron. _janghir_)

I'm a incoming 3rd year undergraduate student at UC San Diego. Recently, I have been working on
web development projects and gridning leetcode for DS and Alogrithms. Outside of work, I love to box/wrestle/do jiu-jitsu, basically anything combat sports related.
I'm from Kazakhstan, so please keep the Borat jokes to yourself... jk I love Borat!
